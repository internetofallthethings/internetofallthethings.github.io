                        <p>
                            This internet of things is a big place. The internet of things has a veritable SHIT TON of 'things' on it. As a matter	 of fact, the internet has All The Things on it. As a thought leader on the IoT and everything
							on the internet, I decided I'd write a blog post. 
                        </p>
						
                        <p>
							The Internet of All The Things requires power in order to run! Literally, the Internet of All The Things needs electricity to power itself. So with that in mind I present this one weird trick you might use when powering some gear.
                        </p>
						
						<p>
							I recently took a look at a salt water disposal well. This well site uses a ton of industrial control and automation gear. This automation equipment is used to monitor various sensors and control things like pumps. This SCADA system 
							is then connected to the internet. This thing-on-the-internet is a member of the internet of things (IoT), or as I prefer to call them, The Internet of All The Things.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							So, you and I know that 'taking a look at' really means 'hack the shit out of.' So on this trip to hack All The Things, I certainly hacked some of the things, but not All The Things. So in my quest to hack further things, I bought one 
							piece of equipment found at the well site I was 'looking at.' The item in question is a human-machine interface that has lots of neat functionality.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I was super excited to place my order from a vendor and receive the ICS gear at my doorstep. The gear arrives, and I hadn't considered the need to power the gear. Opening the box and reading the docs showed I needed 24V power.
							I looked around at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_rail">DIN rail</a> power supplies, since that was how 	the well construction crew powered the equipment. This proved to be a hassle in a number of ways. The biggest hassle
							turned out to be the amount of time it would take to get a DIN rail power supply. So I turned to a local electronics supplier.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I went and picked up a <a href="http://www.vellemanusa.com/products/view/?id=522746">Velleman PS3003U</a> bench power supply. This power supply supports up to 30V and 3A, and looked like it would do the trick. A nice feature of the unit is its
							digital Amp and Volt displays. You lock in the voltate you want and load it up!
						</p>

								class="pure-img-responsive"
								src="/img/post/000/ps3003.jpg">
								</a>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							Of course, this expensive-ass power supply worked. I would have been PISSED at my stupidity if I bought something that didn't work. That would mean I hadn't done my homework. I happily went about my tasks of looking at the ICS gear I was now powering. After about a week I had a sudden realization. One important detail to note here is I found the gear draws about 0.3A.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Back when I was looking for what power supply to get, I was talking with another ICS/SCADA security researcher, who mentioned that back in the day he would power 24V on the cheap using multiple ATX-12V power supplies wired in series. That sounded really cool. After considering what he mentioned, I realized that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">Power-over-Ethernet</a> (PoE) equipment I've seen tends to use 24V or 48V. Being that I have some PoE equipment, I wanted to see if I could have saved myself a ton of money. 
						</p>	
						
						<p>
							Looking at <a href="http://www.ispsupplies.com/brands/Accessories_12/Ubiquiti-POE-24-12W.html">this PoE adapter</a> from <a href="http://ubnt.com">Ubiquity</a>, I see its output is 24V, 0.5A. This falls right in line with what the equipment needs. Looking at the PoE specifications, it seems that pins 4 and 5 are +24V, and pins 7 and 8 are -24V. I measured the voltage off those pins, and once I was satisfied it might work, I wired the PoE adapter in place of my much more expensive bench supply.

								</a>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							TL;DR -- hopefully you skipped all that search engine trolling I did above. This is the punchline: a properly wired 24V PoE adapter powered the SCADA gear perfectly. That fucking PoE brick costs $18! The bench power supply cost about $100 more! I felt really stupid once I found this out. Don't get me wrong, I am glad to have a proper power supply, but when I take this gear on the road, which power supply do you think I'm taking with me?

						   Thanks for reading along. This post wasn't the most highly-technical, and didn't feature any talk about IoT security. I'm just going to blog about the things I see when I go 'looking at stuff.' Hit me up at <a href="http://twitter.com/internetofall">@InternetOfAll</a>.
