						<p>
							At a recent <a href="http://takeonme.org/">Austin Hackers Anonymous</a> meeting, I presented the first small amount of progress I made in
							a SCADA security research project I've recently begun. As you'll see shortly, I'm not a very creative code name inventor.
							
						</p>
						
						<p>
							<img src="img/post/001/project-redlion-title-slide.png">
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The object of my research as part of this project is the Red Lion Controls G306a human machine interface. That's a fancy 
							way of saying, "computer with a touchscreen, dedicated buttons, and tons of attack surface." I recently ran into this device
							in the wild. This device served as the master ICS controller for the entire site. On-site users interact directly with this device 
							to open valves, operate pumps, and monitor tank levels. Remote operators can do this over a web interface. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The G306a is interesting from simply a network protocol perspective. This embedded device runs a web server, speaks more SCADA 
							protocols than C-3PO, and has some really interesting programmability features. It runs a system called the Crimson 3.0 Runtime.
							There's tons of work I want to do with this device. I'm going to try and contribute tools and knowledge about all the things, because
							these are things on the Internet of All the Things!
						</p>
						
						<h3>Crimson 3.0 programming protocol in Wireshark</h3>
						<p>
							I became interested in the TCP protocol the Crimson v3.0 desktop software uses when communicating with the G306a. If you configure
							a panel to allow network updates, the device will listen to TCP port 789 by default. Asset owners program the device interface,
							configure protocols to operate in the ICS environment, update firmware, and even add self-written executable source code.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I started digging into the protocol, and have a very basic parser working in wireshark. If you have a Red Lion device, you can perform
							basic protocol decoding by installing this Lua script into your environment. Edit the file <code>~/.wireshark/init.lua</code> and add something
							similar to the following.
						</p>

						<p>
							<code>
								dofile(os.getenv("HOME") .. "/path-to/cr3.lua")
							</code>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The protocol is a TLV structure with a TLV inside the payload. I'm still working on decoding these subtypes, but I wanted 
							to share the code I've written in case it might benefit someone out there.
						</p>

						<p>
							Go download the code for this Wireshark dissector over at <a href=https://github.com/internetofallthethings/cr3-wireshark>GitHub</a>
						</p>

						<h3>Fingerprinting Red Lion Control devices remotely</h3>

						<p>
							I want to be able to look out over the Internet of Things and find these devices. If you're doing SCADA/ICS security audits, 
							you may at some point run into one of these devices on your target network. The presence of a listening socket on TCP port 789
							is likely sufficient to identify a Red Lion HMI device. However, the protocol supports a couple of messages types for identifying
							the device manufacturer and model number. So I've also released an Nmap script that will fingerprint the device.
						</p>
						<p>
							Go download the code for this Nmap NSE script over at <a href=https://github.com/internetofallthethings/cr3-nmap>GitHub</a>. It 
							looks like this script, with a few modifications, should get included in the Nmap build at some point. I'll keep you updated.
						</p>

						<h3>Project Redlion</h3>
						<p>
							This project will be ongoing for awhile. Keep a look out on this blog and over on Twitter <a href=https://twitter.com/internetofall>@InternetOfAll</a>.
							I will continue dropping code and science on your fucking ass! Booyakasha!

                        <p>
                            This internet of things is a big place. The internet of things has a veritable SHIT TON of 'things' on it. As a matter	 of fact, the internet has All The Things on it. As a thought leader on the IoT and everything
							on the internet, I decided I'd write a blog post. 
                        </p>
						
                        <p>
							The Internet of All The Things requires power in order to run! Literally, the Internet of All The Things needs electricity to power itself. So with that in mind I present this one weird trick you might use when powering some gear.
                        </p>
						
						<p>
							I recently took a look at a salt water disposal well. This well site uses a ton of industrial control and automation gear. This automation equipment is used to monitor various sensors and control things like pumps. This SCADA system 
							is then connected to the internet. This thing-on-the-internet is a member of the internet of things (IoT), or as I prefer to call them, The Internet of All The Things.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							So, you and I know that 'taking a look at' really means 'hack the shit out of.' So on this trip to hack All The Things, I certainly hacked some of the things, but not All The Things. So in my quest to hack further things, I bought one 
							piece of equipment found at the well site I was 'looking at.' The item in question is a human-machine interface that has lots of neat functionality.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I was super excited to place my order from a vendor and receive the ICS gear at my doorstep. The gear arrives, and I hadn't considered the need to power the gear. Opening the box and reading the docs showed I needed 24V power.
							I looked around at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_rail">DIN rail</a> power supplies, since that was how 	the well construction crew powered the equipment. This proved to be a hassle in a number of ways. The biggest hassle
							turned out to be the amount of time it would take to get a DIN rail power supply. So I turned to a local electronics supplier.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I went and picked up a <a href="http://www.vellemanusa.com/products/view/?id=522746">Velleman PS3003U</a> bench power supply. This power supply supports up to 30V and 3A, and looked like it would do the trick. A nice feature of the unit is its
							digital Amp and Volt displays. You lock in the voltate you want and load it up!
						</p>

								class="pure-img-responsive"
								src="/img/post/000/ps3003.jpg">
								</a>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							Of course, this expensive-ass power supply worked. I would have been PISSED at my stupidity if I bought something that didn't work. That would mean I hadn't done my homework. I happily went about my tasks of looking at the ICS gear I was now powering. After about a week I had a sudden realization. One important detail to note here is I found the gear draws about 0.3A.
						</p>

								</a>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							Back when I was looking for what power supply to get, I was talking with another ICS/SCADA security researcher, who mentioned that back in the day he would power 24V on the cheap using multiple ATX-12V power supplies wired in series. That sounded really cool. After considering what he mentioned, I realized that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet">Power-over-Ethernet</a> (PoE) equipment I've seen tends to use 24V or 48V. Being that I have some PoE equipment, I wanted to see if I could have saved myself a ton of money. 
						</p>	
						
						<p>
							Looking at <a href="http://www.ispsupplies.com/brands/Accessories_12/Ubiquiti-POE-24-12W.html">this PoE adapter</a> from <a href="http://ubnt.com">Ubiquity</a>, I see its output is 24V, 0.5A. This falls right in line with what the equipment needs. Looking at the PoE specifications, it seems that pins 4 and 5 are +24V, and pins 7 and 8 are -24V. I measured the voltage off those pins, and once I was satisfied it might work, I wired the PoE adapter in place of my much more expensive bench supply.
						</p>

								class="pure-img-responsive"
								src="/img/post/000/poe.jpg">
								</a>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							TL;DR -- hopefully you skipped all that search engine trolling I did above. This is the punchline: a properly wired 24V PoE adapter powered the SCADA gear perfectly. That fucking PoE brick costs $18! The bench power supply cost about $100 more! I felt really stupid once I found this out. Don't get me wrong, I am glad to have a proper power supply, but when I take this gear on the road, which power supply do you think I'm taking with me?

						   Thanks for reading along. This post wasn't the most highly-technical, and didn't feature any talk about IoT security. I'm just going to blog about the things I see when I go 'looking at stuff.' Hit me up at <a href="http://twitter.com/internetofall">@InternetOfAll</a>.
